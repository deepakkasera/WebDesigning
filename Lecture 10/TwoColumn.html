     <p id="p1">My wonderful daughter made me a red velvet birthday cake this year using her own special combination of creativity and love. It was huge and I cut myself the biggest piece. With the first bite I closed my eyes and smiled. It was so moist and sweet. The butter cream icing on top was delightfully thick. It had countless calories and it was so delicious without being necessarily nutritious.</p>
     <p id="p2">Remember that promising actor from not so long ago? You would regularly sit in the theater and watch his plays unfold. He wasn't bad, but over the years his work had become very sloppy. His performances were now unpredictable. As attendance numbers dwindled, what was once a potentially good play was becoming a waste of your time and money. A movie ticket to be thrown away halfway in. </p>
